# Introduction

This TypeScript Engineering Guide serves as a comprehensive reference for development teams building production applications with TypeScript. It covers essential patterns, configuration strategies, and architectural decisions necessary for maintaining large-scale TypeScript codebases.

## Terminology

This Style Guide follows [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) terminology for normative language:

- **MUST / MUST NOT**: Absolute requirements with no exceptions
- **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT**: Strong recommendations that may have valid exceptions in specific circumstances
- **MAY**: Optional suggestions or acceptable alternatives

The terms **prefer** and **avoid** correspond to **should** and **should not** respectively. Imperative statements (e.g., "Use const for immutable variables") and declarative statements (e.g., "Variables are declared with const") represent absolute requirements equivalent to must.
When exceptions to should rules are necessary, document the rationale in code comments or team decision records.

## Guide Notes

All code examples provided in this guide are non-normative and serve solely to illustrate the application of style rules. While examples follow the prescribed style guidelines, they do not represent the only acceptable implementation. Alternative approaches that comply with the stated rules are equally valid.

Optional formatting choices demonstrated in examples—such as line breaks, spacing, or parameter ordering—must not be treated as mandatory requirements unless explicitly specified in the normative text. Teams should focus on adherence to the core rules rather than exact replication of example formatting.
