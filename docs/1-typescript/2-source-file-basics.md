# Source file basics

## File encoding: UTF-8

Source files are encoded in UTF-8.

### Whitespace characters

Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (`0x20`) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that all other whitespace characters in string literals are escaped.

### Special escape sequences

For any character that has a special escape sequence (`\'`, `\"`, `\\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding numeric escape (e.g `\x0a`, `\u000a`, or `\u{a}`). Legacy octal escapes are never used.

### Non-ASCII characters

For the remaining non-ASCII characters, use the actual Unicode character (e.g. `∞`). For non-printable characters, the equivalent hex or Unicode escapes (e.g. `\u221e`) can be used along with an explanatory comment.

```
// Perfectly clear, even without a comment.
const units = 'μs';

// Use escapes for non-printable characters.
const output = '\ufeff' + content;  // byte order mark
```

```
// Hard to read and prone to mistakes, even with the comment.
const units = '\u03bcs'; // Greek letter mu, 's'

// The reader has no idea what this is.
const output = '\ufeff' + content;
```
